Creation of a retrieval-based chatbot using predefined input patterns and responses.

The chatbot is trained on a dataset which contains categories (intents), patterns and responses. 
We use a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the user's messge belongs to and then,
we give a random response from the list of responses that we created.
